# Training scripts overview
- model_main.py: Obtained from [tensorflow object detection library](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/export_inference_graph.py) (August 2018). Primary script used to run model training.
- pascal_lavel_map.pbtxt: Protobuffer text file containing label name and id information. Referenced in pipeline.config.
- pipeline.config: Contains hyperparameter and training parameters for the [faster_rcnn_inception_resnet_v2_atrous_coco](http://nextcloud.sfei.org/index.php/s/Fsjz7EC5yLBFbaE) model (circa 2018), included for convinience. If you choose to use another base model for transfer learning you'll need to replace this with the respective pipeline.config file.
- run_training.cmd: Windows bash script for starting the training process. Used as a convienience for faster iterations.
